# About me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on various projects that interest me and allow me to become more efficient effective and productive. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux, Neovim, MarkDown, Git, and NextCloud.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Father Lemaitre, a Catholic Jesuit priest, had proposed the Big Bang theory using only the mathematics of Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity.  In 1933, after hearing Father Lemaitre personally explain his theory, Albert Einstein declared “This is the most beautiful and satisfactory explanation of creation to which I have ever listened.”
